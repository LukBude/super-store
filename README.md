# WebShop

This project shows how to implement the frontend of a simple eCommerce application using Angular. 

### How to start the app

In order to open the app, clone this GitHub repository, navigate into the root directory and open a console. Run "npm start". As long as you have node.js installed on your PC, 
the previous command should start the application and you should be able to checkout the frontend by visiting http://localhost:4200/ in a browser of your choice.

### Some more information

Keep in mind that this project does not provide a backend. The images and data shown on the front page are read from the data.json file located inside the assets folder. 
The project is a fairly simplified solution that shows how the scaffold of an eCommerce frontend can be build very quickly. Obviously there are some important features missing,
such as the login mechanism and a generalized version of a spinner.
